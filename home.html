                <h3>Rental Yeild</h3>
                <p>Rental Yeild is the net money made by the property though rent with respect to the purchase price of the property.
                This is similar to dividends in the stock market, where the rent acts as the divident. Moreover, houses having a rental yeild of greater
                than 5% are considered to be good investments.</p>

                <h3>Capital Gain</h3>
                Capital Gain in the increment in the value of the property from the time of purchase, this can be related to how the value of a stock 
               can increase in value after the time of purchase, if the value of the underlying neighbourhood lowers on a yearly basis you are losing on 
               your investment money , hence investing in rising localities is important. Aiming for postcodes with a 10% rise in capital gains over the last 
               5 years is a great starting point.

            <div class="metric-card right" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg,#FFF8F1, #ffffff);">
                <h3>Liquidity</h3>
                <p> Liquidity is how quickly you sell or buy property, even with great property yeild and capital gains if your are unable to quickly sell<br>
            the property when prices are high you lose out on potential profit. Hence making sure that the locality is one with high activity and demand <br>
            is crucial.</p>
